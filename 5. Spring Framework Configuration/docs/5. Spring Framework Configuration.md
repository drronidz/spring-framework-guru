# Spring Configuration Options
* XML Based Configuration : 
  * Introduced in Spring Framework 2.0.
  * Done via an XML schema.
  * Common in legacy Spring Applications.
  * Still supported in Spring Framework 5.x.

* Annotation Based Configuration:
  * Introduced in Spring Framework 3.
  * Picked up via **`Component Scans`**
  * Refers to class level annotations:
    * **`@Controller`**, **`@Service`**, **`@Component`**, **`@Repository`**.

* Java Based Configuration:
  * Introduced in Spring Framework 3.0.
  * Uses Java Classes to define Spring Beans.
  * Configuration classes are defined with **`@Configuration`** annotation.
  * Beans are declared with **`@Bean`** annotation.

* Groovy Bean Definition DSL Configuration:
  * Introduced in Spring Framework 4.0.
  * Allows you to declare beans in Groovy.
  * Borrowed from Grails.
  
## Which to Use?
* You can use a combination of all methods.
* They will work seamlessly together to define beans in the Spring Context.
* Industry trend is to favor Java based configuration.

# Spring Stereotypes : 
* Stereotype : a fixed general image or set of characteristics which represent a particular type
of person or thing.
* Spring Stereotypes are used to define Spring Beans in the Spring context.
* Available Stereotypes : **`@Controller`**, **`@Service`**, **`@Component`**, **`@Repository`**,
**`@RestController`**

## Spring Framework Stereotypes:
* **`@Component`** : `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Controller`.
* **`@Controller`** : `@RestController`.

| Annotation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `@Component` | Indicates that an annotated class s a `component` and it will be created as a bean|
| `@Controller` | Indicates thant an annotated class has the role of a Spring MVC Controller |
| `@RestController` | Convenience Annotation which extends `@Controller`, and adds `@ResponseBody` |
| `@Repository` | Indicates thant an annotated class is a `Repository`, originally define by DDD as a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects |
| `@Service` | Indicates thant an annotated class is a `Service`, originally defined by DDD as an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in the model with no encapsulated state|
